This repository includes the files CareDash.html, CareDash.css, and assorted 
image files for the take-home technical assignment for the Front-end 
Developer internship for CareDash. This webpage was built based off of a 
given basic wire-frame of a webpage. The final webpage is only partially
functional; there are buttons that do not have functions ("Learn More" 
buttons) and some menu items have not yet been set (drop-down menus in
navigation bar).
